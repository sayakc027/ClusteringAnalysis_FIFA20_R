## Problem Statement:
In professional football, it is not uncommon for a player to drop out of team due to contract transfer, contract expiration or medical reasons. By the means of our analysis, we will be trying to find suitable replacements players based on their skillset, strength and physical attributes. We will be doing that by using Clustering Analysis which is an unsupervised learning method. We will be building two different models using K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering and in the end compare both the models to see which one performs better.
